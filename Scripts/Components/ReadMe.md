The goal of this folder is to declutter the index.js file.

Within this folder, you will make modules / components which have use-case specific functions you will
export and use with your index.js file.

An example would be a carousel.js file

This file would contain all the logic required to make a functioning carousel.
You will then import these functions into your index.js file to be used and integrated.
