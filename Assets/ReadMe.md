the assets folder is meant to be where you keep any asset you will reference throughout your web project

i do advice before adding files into this folder (or anything in general) to try and think of a folder structure
this will create a separation of concerns and make it easier to navigate your files, keep them sorted, and versioned

an example would be your images and fonts, you can make a images and fonts folder. you can take things a step further
within a folder like images where you have more sub folders which separate out the images by pages which will conform
to your pages folder in the root directory
